# AI-Customer-Support-Lead-Generation-Agent-for-Website-Phone-Built-on-Voiceflow
AI Agent Chatbot to talk to users via web and phone and answer their questions

PURPOSE ðŸ’­
This agent is designed to be able to answer questions from potential customers via a website chatbot and also viaâ€¨a phone number that can be called. Not only can it answer questions, but it can also generate instant quotes for
interested parties. Finally, the agent is able to capture lead information for those who have been given a quote, this
allows the sales team to follow up and set an appointment.

VALUE ðŸ¤‘
Customers often want instant answers so they can make a purchase, by offering easy ways for them to get 
information we increase their chance of purchasing. Companies typically have to spend money on a customer
support or sales team to get this done, but this agent can be a one-and-done solution, both helping increase sales
while also saving the business money that would be spent on support.

USAGE ðŸŽ¬
Person arrives on website and either clicks to chat with the chatbot or enters the phone number into their phone.
The agent then determines what they are needing help with, and then routes them to the correct tool (knowledge base Q&A or instant quote)
